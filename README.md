## Description

Provide a short description explaining the what, why, and how of your project. Use the following questions as a guide:

This Prework Study Guide was created for boot camp students. The students are able to access the website for notes on topics covered during their study. This should help students overcome the problem of information overload leading to a better learning experience. During this project I learnt how to build and design a website using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.
